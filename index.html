   <h1>COOLEST CARS!!</h1> 
   <P>Following a poll of some of the most informed people around the world-AutoExpres readers-here are the results: it's the ten coolest cars ever!</P>
   <p>But what does it mean for a car to be cool? The cool cars here are the ones that took pride of place as posters on bedroom walls.</p> 
       <p>They have an ageless quality that puts them down as instant classics, but there's something more that makes them cool. </p>
   <p>A car's coolness can be down to looks, it's achievements, the technology on board,or even the performance, there's no fixed definition of what makes a car cool.</p>
   <p>The top ten coolest cars include:
    <ul class="bio">
         <li>Citroen DS</li>
         <li>Jaguar E-Type</li>
         <li>Lancia Stratos</li>
         <li>Land Rover Defender</li>
         <li>Lamborghini Miura</li>

         <li>Audi Quattro</li>
         <li>McLaren F1</li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <h2>ORIGIN OF CAR MODEL NAME</h2>
   <p>The car's model name can also be crucial to its image. </p>
   <p>Something like Shelby Cobra conjures up connotationa of a deadly animal, although the exception to this would be Ferrari-who seem to get by just fine with mere numbers.</p>
   <p>There could be celebrity connection-the cool factor of somebody famous is likely to rub off on what they drive.Film star, Steve McQueen, in the movie Bullitt, gave the Ford Mustang as it is reverred.</p>
